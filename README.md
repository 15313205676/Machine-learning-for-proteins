## Papers on machine learning for proteins

[TOC]


### Background

We recently released a [review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10775) of machine learning methods in protein engineering, but the field changes so fast and there are so many new papers that any static document will inevitably be missing important work. 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public, collaborative list of machine learning papers on protein applications. We try to classify papers based on a combination of their applications and model type. If you have suggestions for other papers or categories, please make a pull request or issue!
